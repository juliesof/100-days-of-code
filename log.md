# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1: Sunday, January 8, 2017
       Completed at time: 7:40pm

Today's Progress: Today I started my tribute page project for Free Code Camp, which I had been avoiding since October. I added headers, content in the form of a list (the timeline), a couple quotes, a photo at the top and a couple links at the bottom. I also chose the color scheme based on wanting a strong red-hued color in the background. I used a color combo website to find colors that would go well together rather than finding random colors that look kind of weird together. I tried to do some centering, but it didn't go well, and I'm going to leave that to another day.

Thoughts: At first it was really hard to start. It actually took an extra hour than when I tried to start (plus some coloring in my new coloring book). Once I was relaxed I opened the laptop again and although I didn't want to do it, I did. I let myself just set up the html and content without worrying about the styling yet, and that made it easier and I ended up in a flow for about 50 minutes.

Day 2: Monday, January 9, 2017
       Completed at: 11:00pm

Today's progress: I decided my Tribute Page looked good and I decided I was done with it. I started on my portfolio page. It took at least 30 minutes to trouble shoot why the background color of the header div wasn't appearing, or only appearing for the menu list. At the last minute I realized it may have to do with the floats, and this turned out to be the case. The float takes the elements out of the doc's flow, and you need to include overflow: auto or hidden - although I don't know what those two properties do. So in 45 minutes I pretty much added a background color. But that's often how it goes.

Thoughts: I was bummed and annoyed with myself for most of the time I was fighting with the non-appearing color. Then when I figured it out - I felt relieved and good.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
